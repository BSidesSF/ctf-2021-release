The flag is computed and printed to logs when the battery percentage is *49*. There are multiple ways to solve this level, you can reverse the APK and find the 3 parts of the flag in strings.xml, variable in MainActivity.java and inline in MainActivity.java.

You could update the battery percentage using adb and view the flag on Logcat 
```adb shell dumpsys battery set level 49
