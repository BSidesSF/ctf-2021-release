The app stores the messages in a Firebase database, due to a misconfiguration anyone can read from the database. 
```
	{
  		"rules": {
    				".read": true,
    				"users": {
      							"$uid": {
        									".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
          									"msg" : {
        												".validate": "newData.val().length <= 25"
          									}
      									}
    						}
  				}
	}
```
By reversing the application or by observing the requests made by the application, you can find the URL for the database and navigate to it. In this case, it is [https://bsides-sf-ctf-2021-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/users.json](https://bsides-sf-ctf-2021-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/users.json).
